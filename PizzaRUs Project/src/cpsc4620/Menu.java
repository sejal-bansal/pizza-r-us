/*
 * This file is where the front end magic happens.
 *
 * You will have to write the functionality of each of these menu options' respective functions.
 *
 * This file should need to access your DB at all, it should make calls to the DBNinja that will do all the connections.
 *
 * You can add and remove functions as you see necessary. But you MUST have all 8 menu functions (9 including exit)
 *
 * Simply removing menu functions because you don't know how to implement it will result in a major error penalty (akin to your program crashing)
 *
 * Speaking of crashing. Your program shouldn't do it. Use exceptions, or if statements, or whatever it is you need to do to keep your program from breaking.
